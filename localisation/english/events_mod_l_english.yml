demo.01.t:0 "The Status of our Alliance with the Southern Union"
demo.01.d:0 "It has over the time become clear that our alliance with the Southern Union was nothing more than an Alliance of Conveinience. After the war against the Germanic Empire we were awared barely any land and our common enemies no longer exist. This alliance is no longer benefitial to us and so we shall end it."
demo.01.a:0 "Long Live the Turul Empire!"

demo.03.d:0 "After successfully having defeaten the Germanic Empire together, the Turul Empire today has announced that they would end their alliance with the Southern Union due to "internal disputes". Not much more is known on the reasoning of this but some speculate it may have something to do with the lack of major gains for the Turul Empire after the Germanic-SU War."

gge.1.t:0 "Ruling Coalition Collapses"
gge.1.d:0 "After Blitz was voted out of the office of Prime Minister by the National Assembly upon Southern Aggression towards the Germanic Empire and suspected collaboration with the Southern Union by him, a coalition out of all parties was formed and backed Skulli as Prime Minister until the war with the Southern Union was won. This term seemed to first have been successful with the military industry successfully advancing and the country being more and more prepared for the war and the efforts seemed to work when the first part of the Invasion by the Southern Union was successfully defeated and the Southern Union suffered heavy casualities. Unfortunately for us, the Southern Union was able to regroup and later defeat us and most of the blame for this is layed on Prime Minister and Head of the Armed Forces Skulli73. Due to this failiure, multiple parties in the all-party government now see Prime Minister Skulli as unfit to lead the country and have withdrawn support from the Prime Minister. It is now unsure whether the government still has the confidence of the National Assembly. In addition to this many cabinet members, especially of those parties that withdrew from the coalition, have given their resignation to the Emperor and it seems as if the Government is collapsing."
gge.1.a:0 "Oh no..."
gge.2.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 1 - The National Assembly convenes"
gge.2.d:0 "For the first time since the Germanic-Southern Union War, what is left of the National Assembly has convened to discuss solutions to the current situation. Unfortunately there seem to be not many solutions to this situation and instead the session has become more putting the blame on someone else. A person especially targetted by this is the Prime Minister."
gge.2.a:0 "The Government truely seems to collapse..."
gge.3.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 2 - Vote of No Confidence"
gge.3.d:0 "During the parliamentary session, a vote of no confidence was brought up by the parties that left the coalition against the Prime Minister. We are as of right now not sure whether the Prime Minister can keep the confidence of the Deputies and seeing as the vote is anonymous preassure on the Deputies does not work either. As the Deputies have voted, the votes have been counted, the President of the National Assembly announces that..."
gge.3.a:0 "the National Assembly still has confidence in the Prime Minister"
gge.3.b:0 "the National Assembly has lost confidence in the Prime Minister"
gge.4.t:0 "Skulli survives Motion of No Confidence"
gge.4.d:0 "In a parliamentary session in the Germanic Government in exile, Prime Minister Skulli has kept the confidence of parliament in a Vote of No Confidence. He now most likely will form a new government which will be smaller than the previous one due to many vacancies caused by the war between the Germanic Empire and the Southern Union but it is not sure whether the National Assembly will support Skulli in the appointing of a new cabinet."
gge.4.a:0 "He barely survived..."
gge.5.t:0 "Skulli ousted by Motion of No Confidence"
gge.5.d:0 "Prime Minister Skulli of the Germanic Government in Exile today was ousted by a Vote of No Confidence after parts of his coalition withdrew support from him. It is unsure whether the National Assembly will now elect a new Prime Minister, the Emperor appoint one or new elections held."
gge.5.a:0 "It will remain a big question whether this is for the good of them..."
gge.6.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 3 - Prime Minister proposes Anti-Bureaucracy Law"
gge.6.d:0 "Much of the blame for losing the war with the Southern Union was put on inefficient beurocracy stopping us from preparing for war to begin with. While the Senate may have already been de facto abolished when the government went into exile there still are a lot of ministries of which many don't have a real purpose. Due to this Prime Minister Skulli now has proposed a law to the National Assembly to get rid of some Ministries that were left vacant when the government went into exile such as the Ministry of Infrastructure which is to be merged into the Ministry of the Interior. The law is now up for vote and requires a three-fifth majority to be passed after debate is finished."
gge.6.a:0 "Hopefully we can rid this country of bureaucracy!"
gge.7.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 3 - Anti-Bureaucracy Law denied"
gge.7.d:0 "The votes have been casted and tallied and the Deputies are being called into the National Assembly so that the President of the National Assembly can announce the results of the vote. As the Deputies sit down especially the Prime Minister could be seen obviously nervous seeing as due to the needed three-fifth majority it was unsure whether the opposition would take their country or party-based politics first. \nAfter all talks between Deputies started calming down and the President of the National Assembly caused for order in the room he announced: 'There are 4 Ayes, 3 Nays and no Abstentions, the law does not reech the required three-fifths majority and is hereby denied.' and as he slammed his Gavel to the table it was clearly visible that the Prime Minister was disappointed. Later in a speech, the Prime Minister proceeded to accuse those who voted against the law, exclusively members of the opposition, to 'have taken their party before their country'. With this law denied it is unsure how the government will proceed in working against the bueaurocracy in the nation and to efficiently work on reclaiming the fatherland."
gge.7.a:0 "Disappointing... "
gge.8.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 3 - The Future of the leadership?"
gge.8.d:0 "With Prime Minister Skulli being removed from office, the office of Prime Minister now has become vacant. The Deputies in the session today now argue about what to do to get a new Prime Minister. While some call for all parties to rally behind one Prime Minister as it was done with Former Prime Minister Skulli, others call for reelections others call for an election of the National Assembly by all exiles due to its many vacancies. As the debate starts calming down the National Assembly..."
gge.8.a:0 "Agreed to rally behind Sam as Prime Minister."
gge.8.b:0 "Agreed to ask the Emperor to disband the National Assembly and call for reelections."
gge.8.c:0 "Did not agree on anything."
gge.9.t:0 "National Assembly elects Sam as Prime Minister"
gge.9.d:0 "The National Assembly of the Germanic Government in Exile has elected Sam as Prime Minister after Prime Minister Skulli was ousted in a Vote of No Confidence. \n He was elected with support of all parties in the National Assembly and is therefore widely seen as a non-partisan Prime Minister who is supposed to repair the country and conquer Germania back."
gge.9.a:0 "That was quick..."
gge.10.t:0 "Federal Election"
gge.10.d:0 "Due to the Emperor having disbanded the National Assembly on request of the National Assembly, today elections were held. While the Prime Minister is not directly elected, he is elected by the National Assembly which is elected by during this election. Due to this, most of the time the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest political party. \nAfter the nation was fractured when it went into exile, only two major parties are left and have any chance of having their Prime Ministerial Candidate elected. The Liberal Party, the party of Former Prime Minister Skulli with their candidate Ace and the Republican Front with their candidate Sam. As the electorate voted and the votes were tallied..."
gge.10.a:0 "The Liberal Party gained a plurality of seats."
gge.10.b:0 "The Republican Front gained a plurality of seats."
gge.11.t:0 "National Assembly Emergency Session - Day 4 - Emperor Kätz storms National Assembly"
gge.11.d:0 "Today, right after the fourth day of the Emergency Session of the National Assembly started, Emperor Kätz stormed the session and in a long speech announced that due to 'inability by the National Assembly to elect a Prime Minister' and the 'lack of leadership' that follows by it he has decided to appoint Fortressia as Prime Minister without the approval of the National Assembly. He also announced several plans to lessen bureaucracy of which none were approved by the National Assembly either. \nMost see this as a direct attack by the Emperor on the National Assembly and believe that this will turn the National Assembly into nothing more than a facade to make the country seem democratic but due to the clear inefficiency of the system as seen by the failiure to solve the leadership only parts of the National Assembly even went so far as to criticize the Emperor's actions though some suggest this lack of criticism is due to fear of reprocussions now that many freedoms are being abolished."
gge.11.a:0 "This is how a democracy dies, with thounderous applause..."
gge.12.t:0 "Liberal Party wins Election in [FGE.getNameDEF]"
gge.12.d:0 "The Liberal Party, the party of former Prime Minister Skulli, with its candidate Ace has won the election in [FGE.getNameDEF]. The election was held after former Prime Minister Skulli resigned the Prime Ministry and the National Assembly asked Emperor Kätz to dissolve it and hold new elections."
gge.12.a:0 "Congratulations to him!"
gge.13.t:0 "Republican Front wins Election in [FGE.getNameDEF]"
gge.13.d:0 "The Republican Front with its candidate Sam has won the election in [FGE.getNameDEF]. The election was held after former Prime Minister Skulli resigned the Prime Ministry and the National Assembly asked Emperor Kätz to dissolve it and hold new elections.\nWith a Republican winning the election, the fate of the monarchy is now unsure but it is unlikely that a two-thirds majority exists in the National Assembly to abolish the monarchy."
gge.13.a:0 "Congratulations to him!"
gge.14.t:0 "Germanic Emperor appoints loyal Prime Minister"
gge.14.d:0 "Today Germanic Emperor Kätz stormed the National Assembly during a session and announced that he would appoint Fortressia as Prime Minister without approval of the National Assembly. This comes after the National Assembly was unable to agree on any solution for what to do with the Prime Ministry after Skulli was removed from office. In addition to this the Germanic Emperor announced several reforms to politics again bypassing the National Assembly which is wudeky seen as a power play against the National Assembly. Some speculate this may be the end of full democracy in the Germanic Government in Exile but due to the shown inefficiency of the system not many resisted this."
gge.14.a:0 "The death of democracy there..."
gge.15.t:0 "Kätz deposed!"
gge.15.d:0 "Today, Kätz, exiled Emperor of the Germanic Empire, was deposed by the National Assembly.

gge.29.d:0 "After they took over our holdings in Europe, Germania has offered us a deal for peace.

This mission to retake the homeland and destroy fascism has cost him, his country and every citizen in it a lot. \"Was this really the correct thing, has the world become better?\", he thinks to himself."

gge.37.a:0 "We have become the very thing we swore to destroy..."
gge.38.t:0 "The Problem..."
gge.38.d:0 "As Skulli is drafting a new Bill he is once again reminded of the Emergency Powers given to him by the National Assembly. They were once meant to be revokable and non permanent but this has long changed. The National Assembly has become nothing but a place for the Prime Minister to give his speeches and most decisions are done only by the Prime Minister, the Emperor and a few very trusted individuals. He promised to resign after liberating the homeland but nothing came out of that either. This clear greed to power is like an addiction to him and he can do nothing against it."
gge.38.a:0 "There's only one solution..."
gge.39.t:0 "The Solution..."
gge.39.d:0 "The Prime Minister sits in his office in the highest story of the Massive Merkel.

gge.41.d:0 "With the Prime Ministry being vacant, the National Assembly has now convened to address this vacancy and fill it. While it was first thought that the National Assembly would simply elect a new Prime Minister but the problems with this were found relatively quickly. The National Assembly has long stopped being representative of the people due to its last election being before the 1st Southern Union-Germania War and many vacancies have occured since this. Due to this the National Assembly instead decided to ask the Emperor to disband it and call for reelections. Upon receiving this, the Emperor did as asked and the Electoral Campaign has now started.\nIn this election the Liberal Party has lost most siginificancy due to the former Prime Minister not candidating and instead the race is between the Anti-Monarchy Republican Front with Acting Prime Minister Sam as its leader and the Pro-Monarchy GNVP with Atalius as its leader."

gge.44.d:0 "Today the Hard-Line monarchist GNVP and the Liberal Party have formed a coalition government after neither the GNVP nor the Liberal have won a plurality in the elections and Atalius was elected Prime Minister.

This counter-government has raised its own troops and many of our soldiers have deserted to them. While as of right now our troops have not yet clashed, we suspect they might soon.\nIn addition to this as the Emperor now is seen as a traitor, the government has called the remaining National Assembly and passed an amendment to the constitution abolishing the monarchy."
